# Zeb GitHub Search App

This project is a **React Native** application built with **Expo**, **TypeScript**, and **NativeWind**. It allows users to search for GitHub users and repositories using the **GitHub API**, with results displayed in a clean and responsive interface.

## Features

- **Search GitHub Repositories**: Search repositories by name and view details such as the repository description, owner, and repo link.
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for mobile devices using **NativeWind** (Tailwind CSS for React Native).
- **Reusable Components**: Search bar, user cards, and headers to ensure clean, modular code.
- **Navigation**: Switch between user and repository searches via a tab navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the mobile app.
